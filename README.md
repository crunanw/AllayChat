## What is AllayChat?

🔰 AllayChat is a modern & powerful chat plugin for PaperMC (and it's forks).\
It allows server owners to create custom chat filters, formats, placeholders and more.

_(Folia support is planned but not implemented yet.)_

⚠️ Allay does not support chat channels.\
I have no plans to add it in the future either.\
I have never seen anyone use it and I don't see a reason to add it.\
It just complicates the chat system and makes it harder to manage.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom chat filters
- Custom chat formats
- Custom placeholders (replacements)
- PlaceholderAPI
- Item in chat

## 📦 Modules

AllayChat is a modular plugin.\
You can install or code modules to your liking.\
Modules are located in `AllayChat/modules` folder.

Currently, AllayChat has the following modules:

- [AllayChat-Multi](https://github.com/VireonStudios/AllayChat-Multi): Cross-server chat support.\
  It allows you to sync chat messages between multiple servers using Redis.
- [AllayChat-AIFilter](https://github.com/VireonStudios/AllayChat-AIFilter): AI-based chat filter & moderation.\
  It punishes players based on their messages.

If you are a developer, you can create your own modules.\
You can find the API in the `Developer` section of this readme.\
Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uAtnreF6Zu) if you want your module to be listed here.

## 🔮 Cross-Server

AllayChat supports cross-server setups.\
You can use AllayChat to sync chat messages between multiple servers.\
This is useful for large networks where you want to have a unified chat experience across all servers.

Allay uses Redis (lettuce) to sync chat messages between servers.\
Thanks to this, AllayChat is very fast and efficient.\
Many other plugins use Plugin Messaging for cross-server support, but it is no way fast as AllayChat's Redis implementation.

Cross-Server feature itself is not included in this repository.\
[You can find it in here.](https://github.com/VireonStudios/AllayChat-Multi)

It is a separate JAR, you put it inside AllayChat/modules.

## 💻 Developers

Allay is designed to be compatible with almost any plugin.\
We use Paper's ChatRenderer to render messages. It means that Allay will not break your existing plugins.\
(as long as your plugin does not do anything weird or outdated)
